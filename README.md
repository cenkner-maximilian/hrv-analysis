# 📊DATA ANALYSIS | HRV READINGS
This project analyzes my own HRV (Heart Rate Variability) readings off of my Apple Watch SE 2022. The data were collected periodically for a duration of around 3 years. 

<h1>ANALYSIS GOALS</h1><br>
📅 | Calculate the monthly averages (+ plot) for:<br>
  • HRV<br>
  • RESTING HEART-RATE<br>
  • RESPIRATORY RATE<br>
  • VO₂MAX<br>

📉 | Identify Low-HRV and High-HRV month(s), find out if any of the measurements besides HRV were off the yearly average.<br>
🔍 | Plot scatters to find out the following:<br>
  • Does daily HRV average tend to increase/decrease/stays the same if sleep is higher? 😴<br>
  • Does increasing VO₂MAX (physical condition measure) mean increasing HRV? 🏃‍♂️<br>

🧠 | Draw any conclusions from the measurements, write a recommendation for further analysis/ exploration.<br>
🖼️ | Create a slide-deck.<br>

<h2>Concise HRV description:</h2>

  Heart rate variability (HRV) is the beat-to-beat variation in heart rate, reflecting autonomic (sympathetic/parasympathetic) balance. In general, higher HRV indicates better fitness and stress-resilience, while lower HRV may signal fatigue, chronic stress or underlying health issues. In healthy adolescent boys, resting SDNN values often fall in the range of roughly 60–100 ms (untrained to athletic), making daily SDNN a useful metric for long-term health monitoring.

    <th>SDNN (ms) Range</th>
    <th>Interpretation</th>
    <th>Possible Causes / Health Associations</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>&lt;50</td>
    <td>Low HRV (Below Typical)</td>
    <td>Chronic stress, fatigue, illness; higher sympathetic tone; potential cardiovascular/metabolic risks.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>50–100</td>
    <td>Normal / Average</td>
    <td>Healthy autonomic balance; routine activity; good recovery and moderate fitness.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>&gt;100</td>
    <td>High HRV (Above Average)</td>
    <td>Excellent recovery; strong parasympathetic tone; often seen in well-trained athletes.</td>

<i>Figure 1</i>

<h2>SUMMARY:</h2>
📈 HRV – Slightly increasing trend. Although there were fluctuations, the overall growth suggests improved recovery or reduced stress in recent months.<br>
❤️ Resting Heart Rate – Decreasing trend. Gradual drop from 2023 to 2025 may indicate better cardiovascular fitness or reduced fatigue levels.<br>
🌬️ Respiratory Rate – Slightly decreasing trend. Stable at first, then declined in 2025, possibly reflecting better breathing efficiency or improved physical condition.<br>
🏃 VO2MAX – Strong increasing trend. Continuous rise from 2023 shows a clear improvement in physical fitness and aerobic capacity.<br>
