# ðŸ“ŠDATA ANALYSIS | HRV READINGS
This project analyzes my own HRV (Heart Rate Variability) readings off of my Apple Watch SE 2022. The data were collected periodically for a duration of around 3 years. 

<h2>Concise HRV description:</h2>

  Heart rate variability (HRV) is the beat-to-beat variation in heart rate, reflecting autonomic (sympathetic/parasympathetic) balance. In general, higher HRV indicates better fitness and stress-resilience, while lower HRV may signal fatigue, chronic stress or underlying health issues. In healthy adolescent boys, resting SDNN values often fall in the range of roughly 60â€“100â€¯ms (untrained to athletic), making daily SDNN a useful metric for long-term health monitoring.

<h2>DIfferent HRV ranges for 16-year-old males (for reference):</h2>
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>SDNN (ms) Range</th>
    <th>Interpretation</th>
    <th>Possible Causes / Health Associations</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>&lt;50</td>
    <td>Low HRV (Below Typical)</td>
    <td>Chronic stress, fatigue, illness; higher sympathetic tone; potential cardiovascular/metabolic risks.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>50â€“100</td>
    <td>Normal / Average</td>
    <td>Healthy autonomic balance; routine activity; good recovery and moderate fitness.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>&gt;100</td>
    <td>High HRV (Above Average)</td>
    <td>Excellent recovery; strong parasympathetic tone; often seen in well-trained athletes.</td>
  </tr>
